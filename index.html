                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                   <p style="font-size: 1.3vw"> I have been a teacher for 5 plus years, working primarily as a History teacher both as a special education teacher in Kansas and in the Alternative setting more locally in the Independence District of Missouri. I have served as a teacher with great passion and conviction and it is something that I will always love and respect. </p>

            <h2>Coding</h2>
                 <p style="font-size: 1.3vw">I have been coding as a hobby on and off for roughly 2 years, then after deciding to leave teaching after five years to explore other career paths I made the desision that I wanted coding to be that new path so now for the past four months I have been coding everysingle day usually for multiple hours a day trying to learn everything I can. I really love coding and I have really enjoyed my time with my classes since they have started. </p>

            <h2>Painting</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1vw">When it comes to art I have been drawing, and painting since I was a kid. I come from a very artistic family, my Aunt Karen and my Dad Kevin specifically. But I have never done much with my art until the past few years. I have, over time, become pretty well versed in the style of spray paint and street art and I have even been comisioned for some art around the city creating some murals under the pen name "Fin.". Art is one of my major passions in life and I would love to continue to persue it as a side career and hopefully my range of art styles can continue to bolster my coding career as well.
